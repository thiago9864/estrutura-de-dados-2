The game has been published under different names but it is a simple race game very much like Backgammon. This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;The three dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice with three marked sides and one blank side. A throw of three marked sides means move 5 squares or enter 1 piece and throw again. Throwing three blank sides means move 4 squares and throw again. A throw of two marked and one blank side means move 1 square and throw again. Throwing two blank and one marked side means the turn ends.&#10;&#10;There are three special types of space on the board. Landing on a Bonus Double space allows you to move your piece forward by the same amount that you moved there with. Landing on a Bonus Rosette square allows you to move one piece onto the board. Landing on a Penalty Eye square allows the opponent to move one of his pieces 4 spaces.&#10;&#10;First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.&#10;&#10;

User review: There are sixty vampires chits; ten vampires each of six different colors. The vampires are shuffled face down and distributed evenly among the players. Each player lines up one&rsquo;s own vampires and reveals the identity of the vampires on both ends. The grave lids have the same distribution of colors as the vampires with the addition of six lids which have rats on them. Six lids are randomly removed and temporarily set aside from the rest and replaced with the lids with the rats on them. The lids are shuffled thoroughly then each lid is placed face down on one of the hollow graves on the game board. Each player receives three garlic chits of a unique color.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn turns over a grave lid. If the color of the obverse side of the lid matches the color of the vampire on either end of one&rsquo;s own line then the player may put the vampire in the grave. If the grave is empty and the color of the lid does not match either vampire on the player&rsquo;s ends then the player may place a garlic chit in the empty grave and replace the lid.&#10;&#10;If the grave already contains a vampire then receives a wooden stake. When a player collects three wooden stakes all the other players give one of their vampires to that player. Should the grave contain garlic placed by another player

Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.
