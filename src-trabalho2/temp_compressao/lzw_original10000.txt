A collectible card game from Steve Jackson aimed directly at the kids.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with everything you need and boosters just add more options.  Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.&#10;&#10;

The game has been published under different names but it is a simple race game very much like Backgammon. This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;The three dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice with three marked sides and one blank side. A throw of three marked sides means move 5 squares or enter 1 piece and throw again. Throwing three blank sides means move 4 squares and throw again. A throw of two marked and one blank side means move 1 square and throw again. Throwing two blank and one marked side means the turn ends.&#10;&#10;There are three special types of space on the board. Landing on a Bonus Double space allows you to move your piece forward by the same amount that you moved there with. Landing on a Bonus Rosette square allows you to move one piece onto the board. Landing on a Penalty Eye square allows the opponent to move one of his pieces 4 spaces.&#10;&#10;First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.&#10;&#10;

An interesting variant on the monopoly theme which introduces stocks and bonds on top of the basic well-known monopoly theme.&#10;&#10;There are four mayor differences to monopoly:&#10;&#10;1) The Bank&#10;The Bank area (twelve special squares with different possibilities) is now the most crucial place in the game where you buy properties and stocks and get paid dividend of your stocks. Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.&#10;&#10;2) Stocks&#10;Stocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.&#10;&#10;3) Car&#10;In Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.&#10;&#10;4) Bonds&#10;Bonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.&#10;&#10;The 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of &quot;Finans&quot; by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by &quot;Martin Marte&quot;. &quot;Finans&quot; means &quot;Finance&quot; but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.&#10;&#10;So far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark
